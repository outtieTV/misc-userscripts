# CHANGELOG
v1.0 Script pauses a youtube.com video at 3 seconds left. Script works when enabled in tampermonkey with no buttons injected into youtube.com<br />
v1.1 Script injects a toggle arrow (->) into youtube.com next to any title<br />
v1.2 Script now has a memory for if the toggle is on or off using localstorage<br />
v1.3 Script now checks for &list= in url and only injects the button into playlist videos, such as &list=WL
