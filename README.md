# Misc UserScripts

# yt-autonext-stopper
A userscript that pauses youtube.com videos when a few seconds are left to prevent autonext.<br />
<br />
While autoplay next recommendations have a toggle button and many toggle userscripts exist, playlists such as watch-later do not have a way to only play one video at a time. So, I wrote this userscript to toggle autonext for playlists. An arrow ( -> ) appears next to the title of the youtube video.

# yt-autoexpand-description
A userscript that automatically expands youtube.com video descriptions.

# yt-align-metadata
A userscript that centers metadata on youtube.com videos.

# yt-time-remaining
A userscript that shows time remaining on youtube.com videos by prefixing the title in HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND format - and counts down as the video progresses.

# ttv-hide-unwanted
A userscript that hides unwanted buttons on twitch.tv (subscribe, gift subs, bits)
