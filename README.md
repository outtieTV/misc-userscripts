# yt-autonext-stopper
A userscript that pauses youtube.com videos when a few seconds are left to prevent autonext.<br />
<br />
While autoplay next recommendations have a toggle button and many toggle userscripts, playlists such as watch-later do not have a way to only play one video at a time. So, I wrote this userscript to toggle autonext for playlists. An arrow ( -> ) appears next to the title of the youtube video.
